# Uppgift-5-Rework-Grupp

## Metropolfoodcourt

### Planning
- Our plan was to remake an existing food website (https://metropolfoodcourt.se/). We wanted to make it easier to navigate and find the food you were looking for.

### Start
- The start menu has been completely redesigned from the ground up and it has a new style on the page. It has become easier to read and easier to navigate through. It still has all the infomation like the old one. It's a simple design on the page and it works without any problems.

### Menu
- 

### Contact
- The contact looked pretty good to begin with. The problem was with the contact-cards. The cards looked cut-off and kind of unfinished because of it. We remade them with the same layout, just with a bit more space above the cards. The colorscheme was also changed, to match our vision of the website.

### Catering
