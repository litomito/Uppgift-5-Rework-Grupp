## Metropolfoodcourt

### Planning
- Our plan was to remake an existing food website (https://metropolfoodcourt.se/). We wanted to make it easier to navigate and find the food you were looking for.

### Start
- The start menu has been completely redesigned from the ground up and it has a new style on the page. It has become easier to read and easier to navigate through. It still has all the information like the old one. It's a simple design on the page and it works without any problems.

### Menu
- The menu has also been completely redesigned and it has almost the same look as the original website but is easier to read. All of the main categories on the menu are on the same page. The food card looks the same but is more centered on the website and is linked to the main categories, depending on which  category you click on it will take you there smoothly.

### Contact
- The contact looked pretty good to begin with. The problem was with the contact-cards. The cards looked cut-off and kind of unfinished because of it. We remade them with the same layout, just with a bit more space above the cards. The color scheme was also changed, to match our vision of the website.
